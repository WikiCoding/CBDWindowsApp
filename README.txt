This is a Customer/Projects custom Database developed in C#
that runs locally on your Windows Machine.

All the data the application is reading from is store in .txt files named Customers and Projects

For the moment, error handling is not covered but for the most basic issues that can
create issues when the app is reading the files is handled with conditionals.

This is a scalable project that during time might be expanded with new features.

The code is available in Visual Studio Code.

To jump right into using the program, use the "CDB_UI_Starter_Executable.exe" file in the PublishedFiles folder.

Enjoy!
